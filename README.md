🧑‍⚕️ Multiple Disease Prediction System
A Streamlit-based health assistant that predicts the likelihood of Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease using machine learning models. The project integrates multiple ML classifiers trained on medical datasets, providing an easy-to-use web interface for patients, healthcare learners, and researchers.

🚀 Features
🔹 Diabetes Prediction based on medical parameters like glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, age, etc.
🔹 Heart Disease Prediction using chest pain type, cholesterol, blood pressure, ECG results, etc.
🔹 Parkinson’s Disease Prediction from biomedical voice measurements.
🔹 Confidence Score (if supported by the model) to indicate prediction reliability.
🔹 Interactive Web UI built with Streamlit for user-friendly predictions.
🔹 Notebook Support (.ipynb) for detailed experimentation and training.

Use Command - Streamlit run "location\ML Project\Main\app.py" in terminal after installing all required dependenices
